<h2>All Hell's Keys, I lost 'em on E Appaloosa Place, Scottsdale, AZ 85259</h2>
<p>2 men sit
  <br>
  Man 1: You want to grab a scotch?
  <br>
  Man 2: I'd rather grab a swede.
  <br>
  Both men laugh gingerly.
  <br>
  Man 1: Fraid I don't have much wind in my sails these days. Specially not for chasin skirt.
  <br>
  Man 2 lays piece of Dentyne Ice out on the chrom & formica table and cuts it in half with a pocket knife. Gives half to Man 1. Chews other.
  <br>
  Man 1: I am tired.
  <br>
  Man 2: Nice enough day. I'm just a little sad.</p>
