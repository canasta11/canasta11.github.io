<h2>When Entering Your Own Lover's Apartment</h2>
<p>when entering your own lover's apartment</p>
<p>He smells like caterpillar food.
<br>
He dances like he's handing out mints.
<br>
He walks like he's stepping on live shrimp.
<br>
He's a disaster.
<br>
When he was a kid his father chained a barstool around his neck and left it there until his 18th birthday.
<br>
His mother only had him so he could hold parking spaces for her.</p>
