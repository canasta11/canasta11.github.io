<h2>“Accidents”</h2>
<p>When asked to describe his most recent nightmare the Naval Officer said:
<br>
“I was at my mother’s condo. I guess it was a condo, but not anywhere she’s ever really lived. But ya, she made mashed potatoes n' told me to sit on the couch n' eat 'em, so I walked over into the living room. The couch was beige leather n' she had a uhm, a beige carpet. Everything was beige n' the lights were so yellow n' bright, they were too warm n' too yellow. I tried to ignore them but I couldn’t. They gave me a really awful feeling. I tried to sit on the couch but there were two huge grey uh marble n' gold TV trays blocking my way n' I couldn’t move 'em. I really couldn’t move 'em. N' there were frogs on the television, exotic frogs.”
