<p>a game of football (soccer) can be played when both sides have 10 players plus a goalie officially. it can also be played in other ways especially in a "pick-up" style potentially and probably unofficially. football (soccer) must be played with a round ball. a ball without edges and that has not been compromised or become oblong. that is one o f the laws of football (soccer).</p>
<p> Shall we share? Or would you like your own? I could go either way.

Hamburger, hotdog, some other things I could be talking about when talking about folding paper. But none of this is for you you idiot.</p> 
<p>I bused tables for a bit at a hybrid sports bar / cabaret club in St. Louis called The Lock Box. I used to cycle between a Gravedigger t-shirt and a Chuck's Coffee Shop LBC t-shirt. These were my work shirts so they had a lot of stains on them by the time I left. The Chuck's (Chuck's famous for their "The Weasel" breakfast platter) shirt came in all different colors but luckily I bought a dark green one. I left the cabaret club after a few bad nights. The lights were weird anyway and gave me bad headaches.</p>
<p> I'll admit I took a 12 hour flight from John Glenn Columbus International Airport (CMH) to Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) that had a stop in Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX) and realized afterwards as I was standing at the baggage carousel waiting for my bag that I left the butter out on the counter.</p> 
<p>I don't have a paper plate.</p>
