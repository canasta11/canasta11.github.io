    <p><b>
      I was out one afternoon, sitting on the curb, when a friend of mine passed by and asked if I wanted to go with him to check out some wall decals.<br>
      I wasn't sure what he meant but it sounded like something fun to see.<br>
      We walked a few blocks and around through some sliding garage doors into an open concrete warehouse.<br>
      There was a small drywalled room near the opening.<br>
      My friend walked over and talked there with a woman through a screened window.<br>
      She exited the room through a door on the opposite side and walked out onto the floor.<br>
      My friend followed and waved for me to do the same.<br>
      The warehouse was mostly empty.<br>
      Some guys in hardhats were off in the distance building slanted metal objects that looked like pipe frames for car sized cheese wedges.<br>
      The woman led us to a couple rows of wall decals stacked on the floor.<br>
      She told us to take our time and returned to her small room.<br>
      My friend and I walked slowly along the first row.<br>
      An elephant, an oak tree, a carnival big top, a football player, things like that.<br>
      At the end there was a massive rectangular image of a commercial jet control panel and windshield during a late afternoon, possibly early morning, flight.<br>
      "This is interesting, like a giant airplane" my friend said pointing to the image.<br> 
      Moving on there was a row of life sized, x rated, wall decals of women in revealing poses.<br>
      My friend stood by an image of a woman spread out like a starfish.<br>
      He pointed and said "can you show me a more naked woman?"<br>
      He grinned and shook his head.<br>
      The men in hardhats started to make a lot of noise sawing some metal pipes.<br>
      Sparks were flying around and the men were yelling.<br>
      I thanked my friend for bringing me along but told him I had to go.<br>
      We shook hands and I walked back towards the garage doors.<br>
      As I passed by the small room I saw the woman inside using a xerox machine.<br>
      Outside there were rusted sheets of corrugated steel resting against the building.<br>
      They were probably about 20 square feet.<br>
      I stood by them for awhile and smoked a cigarette.<br>
      It started to rain quite a lot so I walked around the alley and into a nearby McDonalds.<br>
      I ordered a double cheeseburger at the machine by the door and waited there.<br>
      Fifteen or so people crowded around the counter holding receipts.<br>
      A kind of old woman with long grey hair was sitting at a corner table eating a Big Mac with black leather gloves on.<br>
      She had a pair of sunglasses hanging off the tip of her nose.<br>
      "Some guys pay good money for that stuff" I thought.<br>
      3 Italian guys with hiking backpacks came in and pushed past me to order food at the machine.<br>
      They didn't seem to know much English and they kept saying "patata, patata."<br>
      One of them said "okay" loudly at another one.<br>
      Their backpacks shook and the zippers made rattling sounds as they tapped on the touch screen.<br>
      Suddenly I was pushed forward again.<br>
      This time by what seemed to be an entire lesbian baseball team.<br>
      They were wearing royal purple jerseys and gray pants with double purple stripes down the side.<br>
      Some of them were very wet and wringing their hats out onto the floor.<br>
      All of them were cursing the rain and saying "rainout."<br>
      They took turns at the machine.<br> 
      The Italian guys pushed past me again towards the counter holding their receipts in the air.<br>
      A small woman with reading glasses on was calling numbers.<br>
      "386" she said and a guy came up and got his tray.<br>
      This continued for awhile.<br>
      More people came in and I slowly inched closer to the counter.<br>
      By the time I got my burger the gloved woman had finished her Big Mac and left.<br>
      I took her seat at the corner table.<br>
      A sophisticated scent lingered in the air likely from the woman's perfume.<br>
      A little like smokey cat pee.<br>
      I ate my burger.<br>
      The baseball women seemed to order trays full of chicken nuggets.<br>
      They laughed and slapped each other on the back as they ate.<br>
      The Italian guys yelled at each other.<br>
      They passed around a tiny map and drank small cups of water.<br>
      I left and the rain was worse so I ran home.</b>
